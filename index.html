            <h2>Overall</h2>
            <p>I am originally a farm girl from a small town in northern Finland. 
                I was interested in languages and literature so I went to study English and Swedish 
                at Tampere University and became a teacher. Unfortunately, 
                there were not enough jobs for language teachers so I started to study 
                programming inspired by my many friends who work in the field.</p>

            <h2>Hobbiest and interests</h2>
            <h3>Writing and fantasy</h3>
            <p>I write fiction, mainly romantic fantasy or other speculative fiction. 
                I started writing when I was 13. I also love to read fantasy novels, 
                watch fantasy series and play fantasy theamed games. I go to fantasy and science fiction conventions.</p>
            <h3>Historical re-enactment</h3>
            <p>I do historical re-enactment with my family. The main period we do is the Middle Ages and the 
                Renaissance but I have also some garb for the 18th century. 
                We are part of the international SCA.
                Mainly I make clothes, cook, dance and sing.</p>
            <h3>Gardening</h3>
            <p>At one point I wanted to become a gardener but I'm happy enough with my small yard which has both decorative and edible plants. I have also lots of pelargoniums.</p>
            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>I enjoy different role playing games and have played World of Warcraft for over ten years.</p>
            <h3>Gym</h3>
            <p>I prefer to be strong and started to go to the gym at the age of 13.</p>
            <h3>Dancing</h3>
            <p>I love different kinds of dances and have done all sorts from Latin dances to Renaissance dances to oriental dances.</p>
